# CycloneCanSat
Repository for the Cyclone team (St Paul's School) for the CanSat competition 2015-2016. We are entering the advanced competition this, year, with an attempt to produce an autonomous drone (quadcopter) which will investigate the area below the launch site, also using temperature, humidity (and has a pressure sensor) sensors to calculate dew point. This will be plugged into an algorithm we design to calculate the agricultural viability of the area.
